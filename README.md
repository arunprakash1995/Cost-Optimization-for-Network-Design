# Cost-Optimization-for-Network-Design
The objective of the project is to generate a network topology, with capacities assigned to the links, according to the studied model, using the shortest path based fast solution method i.e Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. The program also computes the total cost of the designed network .
The project is an application to network design. In this project, the number of nodes is given as the input (N) along with the traffic demand values (bij) between pairs of
nodes, and the unit cost values for the potential links (aij).  . The agenda of this project is to design a network given the number of nodes and cost of the link between
nodes.
The agenda of the project is to experiment with the network that has been designed randomly and calculate the optimal cost and network density and analyze how they vary with respect to random connectivity.
Once the network is formed, the shortest path algorithm is used to get the path from the source to destination. The Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path from the source to destination. Once this path has been found the cost of the total network is found.
